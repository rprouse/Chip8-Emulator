As this is a personal project, right now I prefer to do the work myself. 

- If you find a bug, please raise an issue
- If you have suggestions on better ways to write or organize the code, please raise an issue
- If you have suggested fixes, please raise an issue.

I'm working on this for the entertainment value, so while I am active, I would prefer contributions to be done as issues so that I can write all the code.

Thanks,

Rob
